I want to be able to click on the answer and have its style change.
I want to be able to only select one answer option.
I want to be able to deselect the answer and have it style change to to how it was previously.

I want to use a form element for the answers and make the answer buttons a radio button 
Attach an id to each of the radio buttons that I can reference when I click on the answer. 
I can compare ths id to the index in the answers object
The answer I click should be registered and the index of the number
